Notice the double colon notation - ::first-line versus :first-line

The double colon replaced the single-colon notation for pseudo-elements in CSS3. This was an attempt from W3C to distinguish between pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.
    
The single-colon syntax was used for both pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements in CSS2 and CSS1.
    
For backward compatibility, the single-colon syntax is acceptable for CSS2 and CSS1 pseudo-elements.
